## Maven Generator
The Maven Generator is a command-line tool provided by Maven itself. 

### Here’s how it works:

Command Line Interface: You use the command line to create a new project.    

Flexibility: You have complete control over the project structure and dependencies. You specify these in the pom.xml file.     

Customization: Since you're starting with a more basic setup, you can tailor the project exactly to your needs from the ground up.      

Generic: It’s not specific to any particular framework. You can use it to create projects for any type of Java application, not just Spring Boot.     


## Spring Initializer
The Spring Initializer is a web-based tool (also accessible via command line) provided by the Spring team to quickly bootstrap a Spring Boot application. 

### Here’s how it works:

Web Interface: You typically use the Spring Initializer web interface, although it also provides command line options.     

Spring Boot Specific: It’s specifically designed to create Spring Boot projects. The generated project is pre-configured with Spring Boot dependencies.     

Predefined Options: It allows you to select various options and dependencies (like Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, etc.) from a user-friendly interface.      

Quick Start: It provides a ready-to-run application with sensible defaults, saving time in setting up boilerplate configurations.
