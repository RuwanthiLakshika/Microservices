Maven Generator: Use this if you need to create a non-Spring Boot project or if you prefer to have granular control over every aspect of your project's configuration from the beginning.    

Spring Initializer: Use this if you are creating a Spring Boot application and want a quick, hassle-free setup with all necessary dependencies and configurations.
